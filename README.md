 Game - guess the entered word

Hangman is a game that can be played by 2 persons. First one types a word, and the other one tries to guess it.
On the screen is displayed a number of empty boxes representing the word's length (one box for each letter).
Also there is displayed a keyboard. The player must click the button with the corresponding letter he thinks is contained in the word.
If the player doesn't guess the word (he selects 10 letters that are not contained in the word), he looses the game. The letter's button becomes red when not guessed. On the screen will be displayed "Sorry, you lost..." message, the guessing word and there will be available a button to restart the game.
If the player guesses one letter contained in the word, the letter's button becomes green and the letter is displayed in the corresponding text box, in the position it actually is situated in the word.
When the player guesses the word he gets the "Congratulations" message and there will be available a button to restart the game.
You can play it with your friends! :)
Enjoy!
